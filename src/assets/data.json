            "answer": {
                "statement": "IDs and classes are both selectors in CSS",
                "explanation": "ID is used to identify a single element while a class can be used to identify multiple elements.",
                "example": "The ID selector is preceded by a hash sign (#) while the class selector is preceded by a full stop (.)", 
                "illustration": "A good way to remember this is a class is a type of item and the id is the unique name of an item on the page."

            "answer": {
                "statement": "DOCTYPE is an abbreviation for DOCument TYPE and is always associated with a DTD (Document Type Definition)",
                "explanation": "DOCTYPE declaration is required for webpages and send the user agent information on what document type to expect ie what version of html specifications your document respects.",
                "example": "Once a user agent has recognized a correct DOCTYPE, it will trigger the no-quirks mode matching this DOCTYPE for reading the document. If a user agent doesn't recognize a correct DOCTYPE, it will trigger the quirks mode.", 
                "illustration": "The DOCTYPE declaration for the HTML5 standards is <!DOCTYPE html>."

            "question": "What is Event Delegation?",
            "answer": {
                "statement": "Event delegation is a technique for listening to events where you delegate a parent element as the listener for all of the events that happen inside it.",
                "explanation": "Rather than having an event listener on each child element, a single common parent element listens and responds to event triggered on any of its child nodes.",
                "example": "You can target a button child by adding an event listener on the parent div containing the button as a child element.", 
                "illustration": "This is very useful when dynamically adding new elements like buttons  or li etc. to a page via DOM manipulation/after the page has been loaded."
